# Embedding System Dependencies for MCP Conversation Intelligence
# 
# This file contains the dependencies needed for the semantic embedding capabilities
# in the MCP conversation intelligence system.

# Core embedding dependencies
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Vector similarity search (optional but recommended)
faiss-cpu>=1.7.0

# Alternative vector search (if FAISS is not available)
scikit-learn>=1.0.0

# Database and data handling
sqlite3  # Usually included with Python
dataclasses  # Python 3.7+ (usually included)

# Logging and utilities
logging  # Usually included with Python
threading  # Usually included with Python

# Note: Some packages like sqlite3, logging, threading, hashlib, json, 
# datetime, and typing are part of Python's standard library and don't 
# need to be installed separately.
#
# To install the required packages:
# pip install -r requirements_embeddings.txt
#
# For development with all optional dependencies:
# pip install -r requirements_embeddings.txt[dev]
